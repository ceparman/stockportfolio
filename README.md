# stockportfolio

We need a shiny app developed that allows the user to create a portfolio by inputing the weights for a handful of indexes and then push a button that will calculate and populate a dashboard with:
(i) Cumulative Growth of a $100 for the portfolio
(ii) Correlation matrix
(iii) Allocation Pie Chart
(iv) Monthly returns of the portfolio
(v) drawdown of portfolio relative to benchmark
